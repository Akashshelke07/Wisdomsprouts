                <p>The cat (Felis catus), also referred to as the domestic cat, is a small domesticated carnivorous
                    mammal. It is the only
                    domesticated species of the family Felidae. Advances in archaeology and genetics have shown that the
                    domestication of
                    the cat occurred in the Near East around 7500 BC. It is commonly kept as a pet and farm cat, but
                    also ranges freely as a
                    feral cat avoiding human contact. Valued by humans for companionship and its ability to kill vermin,
                    the cat's
                    retractable claws are adapted to killing small prey such as mice and rats. It has a strong, flexible
                    body, quick
                    reflexes, and sharp teeth, and its night vision and sense of smell are well developed. It is a
                    social species, but a
                    solitary hunter and a crepuscular predator. Cat communication includes vocalizations—including
                    meowing, purring,
                    trilling, hissing, growling, and grunting—as well as body language. It can hear sounds too faint or
                    too high in
                    frequency for human ears, such as those made by small mammals. It secretes and perceives pheromones.

                    Female domestic cats can have kittens from spring to late autumn in temperate zones and throughout
                    the year in
                    equatorial regions, with litter sizes often ranging from two to five kittens. Domestic cats are bred
                    and shown at events
                    as registered pedigreed cats, a hobby known as cat fancy. Animal population control of cats may be
                    achieved by spaying
                    and neutering, but their proliferation and the abandonment of pets has resulted in large numbers of
                    feral cats
                    worldwide, contributing to the extinction of bird, mammal, and reptile species.

                    As of 2017, the domestic cat was the second most popular pet in the United States, with 95.6 million
                    cats owned and
                    around 42 million households owning at least one cat. In the United Kingdom, 26% of adults have a
                    cat, with an estimated
                    population of 10.9 million pet cats as of 2020. As of 2021, there were an estimated 220 million
                    owned and 480 million
                    stray cats in the world.

                <h3>Etymology and naming</h3>
                The origin of the English word cat, Old English catt, is thought to be the Late Latin word cattus, which
                was first used
                at the beginning of the 6th century.[4] The Late Latin word may be derived from an unidentified African
                language.[5] The
                Nubian word kaddîska 'wildcat' and Nobiin kadīs are possible sources or cognates.[6]

                The forms might also have derived from an ancient Germanic word that was absorbed into Latin and then
                into Greek,
                Syriac, and Arabic.[7] The word may be derived from Germanic and Northern European languages, and
                ultimately be borrowed
                from Uralic, cf. Northern Sámi gáđfi, 'female stoat', and Hungarian hölgy, 'lady, female stoat'; from
                Proto-Uralic
                *käďwä, 'female (of a furred animal)'.[8]

                The English puss, extended as pussy and pussycat, is attested from the 16th century and may have been
                introduced from
                Dutch poes or from Low German puuskatte, related to Swedish kattepus, or Norwegian pus, pusekatt.
                Similar forms exist in
                Lithuanian puižė and Irish puisín or puiscín. The etymology of this word is unknown, but it may have
                arisen from a sound
                used to attract a cat.[9][10]

                A male cat is called a tom or tomcat[11] (or a gib,[12] if neutered). A female is called a queen[13][14]
                (or sometimes a
                molly,[15] if spayed). A juvenile cat is referred to as a kitten. In Early Modern English, the word
                kitten was
                interchangeable with the now-obsolete word catling.[16] A group of cats can be referred to as a clowder,
                a glaring,[17]
                or a colony.[18]</p>
